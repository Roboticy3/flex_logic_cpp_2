# flex_logic_cpp_2

Godot implementation of some ideas from [flex logic](https://github.com/Roboticy3/flex_logic). I haven't added the exact pathway I'm taking to the designs for that repo yet. Hopefully this becomes the main repo in the future. This is a Godot module, meant to be dropped into the "modules" folder of the Godot source code and then compiled alongside the engine.
